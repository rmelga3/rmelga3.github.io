    "I initially had to make my data set smaller because when I tried to make a graph it took way too long for it to come up. Python wouldn't stop loading so I had to create a smaller sample. When I started I realized that I didn't want my user to be able to pick any 2 columns. This is because either there was too many variables on the axis for the data or because two categorical columns wouldn't create a graph. Therefore I selected certain columns where I could actually plot the data without an error and the graph looked neat. I took out columns like duration because it had way too many variables on the axis to plot. I selected country as my categorial column because it was the only categorical column that made the graph look neat and made sense. It didn't have a large amount of variables and the length of the country names were short. Columns like this were unreadable on the graph. I selected duration seconds for my color as I got an error when the color was a categorical column. Another reason why I only selected duration seconds is because when there were any words or symbols in the data of the other columns there was an error when I took the nlog10 of it. Lastly I use plt.colormaps() for my cmap and I was easily able to switch through the available color map options"

    "When I first started this section of the assignment I knew certain columns wouldn't be able to shown in a histogram. So I knew I had to take off certain categorical columns like city, comment, and duration as the labels on the x-axis were too long and it was no readable. I then got rid of numerical data like duration_seconds because the data was presented correctly. I initially tried to plot the data without an if or else statement but I would get an error when I tried to plot my categorical data. So I realized I needed to make an if else statement where I check if the column is a number or not and I plot the data based on the if else statement. After this it worked right away and I was able to move my number of bins and pick which column I wanted to plot. The only main issue I have is that when the number of bins is very low it is not informative."
